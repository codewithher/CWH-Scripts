- [👉 Know what a website is]()
	- Examples of websites 
	- Website Mental Model
	- Website Activity
- Why are we building a website?
- Design our website

notes:
Over the next few videos, we'll cover each of these topics before we get started with the fun stuff!
Let's start with the "what" of websites.

---
### What is a website?

![website](https://media.giphy.com/media/SpopD7IQN2gK3qN4jS/giphy.gif)

- A collection of files on the internet
- We can visit websites through the browser

notes:
Just like a street address, if we wanted to go visit a friends house, we'd go to their address and show up. For websites, if we wanted to visit YouTube, then we would go to YouTube's address. That's what the URL is, an address to a website's files.

---

 ### Websites solve problems.
- We only visit if there's a reason to visit

![mission accomplished](https://media.giphy.com/media/12e5dX36aMp2Ba/giphy.gif)

notes:
Like most things in the world, websites are created to solve problems. If they don't solve problems, there's not really a reason to visit.

---

### 🎯 What's your favorite website?

> [!Activity] 
> Share your favorite website and why you like that website in classroom comment

notes: we can have the students share their website in google classroom comments

---
### Let's build a mental model

> **[Mental Model](https://jamesclear.com/mental-models#:~:text=The%20phrase%20%E2%80%9Cmental%20model%E2%80%9D%20is,understand%20how%20the%20economy%20works.)**: a representation of how something works

notes:
Mental models are just a well-defined way of saying "yes I know how this works, it works like this." 

We'll be building our own mental model of how websites work but first...

### Deconstructing a cookie
![Cookie](https://media.giphy.com/media/bAlYQOugzX9sY/giphy.gif)

notes:
let's start by building a mental model of a cookie so we can get more practice because

---
### Cookies are more like websites than you think

notes:
It turns out that cookies are more like websites than you think.

- Cookies can be defined with 3 characteristics
	- What they're made of
		- Structure
			- Butter
			- Flour
			- Eggs
		- Content
			- Sugar
			- Chocolate Chip
			- Peanut Butter
	- How they look
		- Shape
		- Color
		- Arrangement of content
	- The rules the governs how our interactions change the cookie
		- Recipe
		- Time spent in the oven
		- Effects
			- how soft or crunchy it is
			- how hot it is
- Websites can also be defined by 3 characteristics
	- What they're made of
		- These ingredients are described by a file called HTML
	- How they look
		- The appearance are described in a file called CSS
	- The rules that govern how our interactions change the website
		- The science and movement and characteristics of the cookie can be changed with JavaScript

### Cookie vs Website

![[2-website_vs_cookie.png | Website vs Cookie]]
notes:
Let's look at how well we were able to apply our model of a cookie, to use as an analogy to better understand our website.

### 🎯 [Intro-HTML-Cookies](https://codepen.io/totally-not-frito-lays/pen/dyamGaz)

> [!Activity] 
> Open up this [example](https://codepen.io/totally-not-frito-lays/pen/dyamGaz) and try changing it to say: "Hello world, my name is Alice!"

notes:
Let's try messing around with a real website. Try out the example from our mental model.

## 📍 Why are we building a website?
- ~~Know what a website is~~
- Why are we building a website?
	- [👉 What problem are we solving?]()
	- What types of websites are there?
	- Brainstorming Content Activity

### Why are we building a website?

To sell cookies!

### How do do websites help? 

We are building a **marketing** website to leverage **e-commerce** to sell cookies.

notes:
So how do websites help? Well, it gives us a platform. What we're officially building is a marketing website to leverage e-commerce to sell cookies.

---
### How do do websites help? 

We are building a **marketing** website to leverage **e-commerce** to sell cookies.

> **[Marketing](https://www.ama.org/the-definition-of-marketing-what-is-marketing/)**: activity and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers.

notes:
Let's break down our goal. Marketing. Marketing is the process of selling goods to customers.

---
### How do do websites help? 

We are building a **marketing** website to leverage **e-commerce** to sell cookies.

> **[E-Commerce](https://sell.amazon.com/learn/what-is-ecommerce)**: is the trading of goods and services on the internet

notes:
E-Commerce, that's the practice of selling goods on the internet.

---
### Why E-Commerce?

> [!Source] 
> According to [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/blog/retail-ecommerce):
> - No cost for "overhead" (building upkeep, rent, utilities, etc.)
> - Travel time is spent by shippers, not buyers

notes:
But why sell it on the internet if it's easy enough to open up a stand and sell it ourselves?

Well, we are in the information era, which basically means everything is on the internet. 

It's far easier to find things on the internet than it is in-person. So we put it on the internet. This also has the benefit of not costing extra for overhead and upkeep, or the price of renting, utilities, and other things we need to spend money on to stay open). It also is more convenient because we can outsource shipping costs to somebody else.

It's just easier for both sides.

---
### What are the [types of websites]()?

notes:
Now that we know what problems we're solving, let's check out what types of websites there are.

- Generally 2 categories of websites
	- Static - it doesn't change much
	- Dynamic - it changes a lot
- Less of a categories question, more of a spectrum
- Where does an e-commerce website land?
	- somewhere in the middle

### 🎯 Brainstorming Content Activity

> [!Activity]
> - ✅ Brainstorm why people should buy cookies. 
> - ✅ Describe who you are.
> - ✅ Brainstorm 4-5 words or emotions
> - ✅ Describe what your troop does
>

notes:
Now that we know about why we would build a website and what types of websites there are. Let's write down some information about our goals, ourselves, and our product.

To do this, check out this [Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1re3KItx1baCJy7j0T21a3aVNsxjaJNiFn-8xIdT2__Q/edit?usp=sharing) or write down your answers on a different sheet of paper.

- Why buy cookies
	- They’re delicious and they support local troops!
- Who are you?
	- I’ve been a scout for x years. I like to ride bikes and make websites and I want to sell 4 packages of cookies! 
- Words
	- Satisfy
	- Delicious
	- Happy
	- Support
- What does your troop do?
	- Hiking
	- Community Service

## 📍 Design our website
- ~~Know what a website is~~
- ~~Why are we building a website?~~
- [👉 Design our website]()
	- Mood board
	- User Flow and Prototype

notes:
Now that we know what a website is and why we want to build one, let's see how we can build one. Starting with the design of the website.

---
### What is a mood board?

> **[Mood Board](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mood-boards/#:~:text=A%20mood%20board%20is%20a,cinema%2C%20industrial%20and%20interior%20design)**:  a collage of images, video frames, patterns, or text that convey a certain feeling at a glance. **inspiration board**

notes:
Designers, much like artists can get inspiration from anywhere. So we borrow a technique that artists use called "mood boarding." This is basically a inspiration board where we put in everything that seems interesting to us in one place.

---
### Our mood board

> [!Activity]
> Check out our moodboard!

notes:
- notice how it doesn't have to be pretty
- Includes buyers, sellers, product, and the website type
	- can be any categories but it's generally good to learn how to break down everything that's involved in the website while we're in the design phase

### User flow

> **[User Flow](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-are-user-flows/)**: diagrams that display the movements a user makes when using a product.

notes:
This is important for us to do because it allows us to figure out when the user should make what decisions. In our case, we want to map out how users might land on our website, what they might be interested in, and how we can best streamline this experience.

This is similar to writing an outline before you write an essay or report. You want to know what topics you're visiting in advance, to make sure you get all the important points.

---
### Prototype

> **[Prototype](https://www.figma.com/resource-library/what-is-prototyping/)**: ensure your design works in the hands of a user.

notes:
This is important for us to do because it allows us to see if our plan works. Sometimes when we make designs, we design as engineers and what is easiest for us to make and do. At the end of the day, it's the user experience that's important because it's the user that accomplishes actions that we want to happen.

Here is where we figure out the layout and navigation of our website.

Prototyping is kinda like writing the rough draft. You may have an idea of how our user should visit our site, but until you're actually visiting the site, we don't know for sure if our plan is working. Our mental model may be different from the mental model of our user.

The reason this comes before building the website is that building the website and making changes afterwards is more expensive than prototyping and then making changes to the prototype.

---
### Our user flow and prototype

notes:

Sometimes we get lucky and our user flow is very similar to the prototype. For us, we're going to combine the two into one document. Let's look at our document.
