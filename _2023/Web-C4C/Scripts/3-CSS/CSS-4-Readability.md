### Readability definition

> [Readability](https://anchordigital.com.au/articles/read-between-the-lines-why-legibility-and-readability-is-essential-for-ux#:~:text=Readability%20is%20the%20arrangement%20of,font%20are%20from%20one%20another.): Arrangement of fonts and words in order to make written content flow more easily.

notes:
Readability is about making sure your content is easy to read. The best content in the world isn't going to be worth a penny if nobody can understand it.

That's why when we choose fonts and colors, we want to make sure we can still read what's going on.

Normally this is where we'd talk about spacing, font size, kerning, padding, line length, and contrast, but the biggest thing is just check to make sure your eyes don't hurt when you're reading it. 

If you want to really dig into the science of it, you can check out this article on the [user experience of readability](https://anchordigital.com.au/articles/read-between-the-lines-why-legibility-and-readability-is-essential-for-ux#:~:text=Readability%20is%20the%20arrangement%20of,font%20are%20from%20one%20another.).

notes:
When it comes to fonts, we have a lot more options than you might think. Do you want to be formal or perhaps playful? Do you want to be casual or serious? Fonts can help a lot when deciding the tone and voice of your website.

### Web-Safe Fonts

> [Web-Safe Fonts](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/web-safe-html-css-fonts): fonts that can adapt to any browser, even if the aren't installed.

notes:
Typically we'd have to import in fancy fonts but that can cause issues on some browsers or devices that don't have that font installed. Honestly the web-safe fonts still give quite a lot of options.

You can check out all the different font options on this [article from hubspot](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/web-safe-html-css-fonts).
