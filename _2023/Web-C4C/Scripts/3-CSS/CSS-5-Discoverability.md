notes:
Here's our third building block pattern. the navigation bar. This is the one stop shop to visit every webpage we have access to.

These can be complicated to talk about and make so for now, I'll just show you what they look like and what they do.

When we click this stack of bars, also known as a hamburger menu, notice how it slides out? that makes it accessible for us to see at any size. When we full screen this website, it'll sit at the top of the screen.
