## Identity

1. [👉 Identity]()
2. Readability
3. Discoverability

notes:
Let's reel things back a little bit. When it comes to the UI/UX of our website, we should consider these 3 things. There's generally a lot more than these 3 things to consider, but we're focusing on these for now.

> | 🌐 | 🍪 | 💸 |

notes:

When it comes to identity, we can consider two types: brand identity and visual identity. Brand identity refers to our logo, a single image that represents what we do; our product, the thing we're offering; our mission, what we're hoping to achieve. This is typically handled by the business side of companies.

notes:

Then there's the visual identity. This is defined by colors, fonts, and graphics. We already have the graphics chosen out for you since this is a cookie website, but let's talk about colors here and we'll talk about fonts in readability.

### How many colors do we have?

> [!Question] 
> How many colors do we use on our website?
> (not including images)

notes:

We use 2 in the navigation bar, one for the primary font, one for the white font, one for the ribbon, one for the promotion banner shadow, one for the promotion banner font, two for the buttons, one for the cookie cards, one for the shadow, and two for the goals page. That's a total of 13 different colors. But we forgot to mention the most common color on the website, the white! 

That brings us to a grand total of 5 colors in our color palette.

### Purpose of each color

| Color     | Area             | UI Purpose    |
| --------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| 🔵 Blue   | Navigation       | Brand Color   |
| 🟡 Yellow | Buttons          | Actions       |
| 🔴 Red    | Promotion Banner | Alert         |
| 🟤 Brown  | Section Content  | Content       |
| ⚪ White  | Background       | Neutral Color |


notes:

Well, at first glance, we use blues for the navigation, yellows for the CTAs, a red for the banner, browns for the dividers, and white for the background. To frame this more formally, we have a brand color of blue, secondary / action colors of yellow, alert colors for red, content colors for brown, and neutral color for the white.

These five colors make up our color palette! Or the colors that every other color on our website is made from.

### Color formats

notes:
There are tons of ways to describe colors. The human way is to describe it with words based on things we're familiar with like "ice blue" for a light blue. 

Another common way is with RGB, which describes how much Red, Green, or Blue is in a color.

### HSL 

Hue Saturation Lightness

notes:
The format I like to use is HSL, which stands for Hue, Saturation, Lightness. I really like to use this option because the first option, Hue, defines what general color on the color wheel we're looking at. Saturation tells us how vibrant the color is. Lightness will give us different variations of the color.

Let's check out how we're using it in the website.

Notice how each section of colors has a lot of colors in common. Notice how they all seem like they sort of belong next to each other. Using HSL helps us generate more colors that are part of the core color palette. That's a nice benefit we have as a result of using HSL. You don't get that benefit with other color formats.

### Choose your own color theme!

> [!Activity]
> Change the colors to your own theme!
> - only change the hue values 
> - `hsl(hue, saturation, lightnes)`

notes:
Now it's your turn to customize the website colors! I recommend you only change the hue value. You can use the palette generator but only use the hue. Alternatively you can simply change the first value and see what colors you end up with.
