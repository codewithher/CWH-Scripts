> - Travel time is spent by shippers, not buyers

notes:
But why sell it on the internet if it's easy enough to open up a stand and sell it ourselves?

Well, we are in the information era, which basically means everything is on the internet. 

It's far easier to find things on the internet than it is in-person. So we put it on the internet. This also has the benefit of not costing extra for overhead and upkeep, or the price of renting, utilities, and other things we need to spend money on to stay open). It also is more convenient because we can outsource shipping costs to somebody else.

It's just easier for both sides.
