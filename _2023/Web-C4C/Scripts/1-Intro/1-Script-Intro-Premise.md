I know what you're thinking

### ⛔ We aren't jumping Head First

notes:
That's okay, we're not jumping head first into this. In fact, we've got a few things to cover before we build our website.

## 📍 Know what a website is
- [👉 Know what a website is]()
	- Examples of websites 
	- Website Mental Model
	- Website Activity
- Why are we building a website?
- Design our website

notes:
Over the next few videos, we'll cover each of these topics before we get started with the fun stuff!
Let's start with the "what" of websites.

---
### What is a website?

![website](https://media.giphy.com/media/SpopD7IQN2gK3qN4jS/giphy.gif)

- A collection of files on the internet
- We can visit websites through the browser
- Websites live at URL addresses

notes:
Each website lives at an address. We call a website's address, the URL.

---

 ### Websites solve problems.

![mission accomplished](https://media.giphy.com/media/12e5dX36aMp2Ba/giphy.gif)

- We only visit if there's a reason to visit

notes:
Like most things in the world, websites are created to solve problems. If they don't solve problems, there's not really a reason to visit.

### 🎯 What's your favorite website?

> [!Activity] 
> Share your favorite website and why you like that website in classroom comment

notes: we can have the students share their website in google classroom comments

### Let's build a mental model

> **[Mental Model](https://jamesclear.com/mental-models#:~:text=The%20phrase%20%E2%80%9Cmental%20model%E2%80%9D%20is,understand%20how%20the%20economy%20works.)**: a representation of how something works

notes:
Mental models are just a well-defined way of saying "yes I know how this works, it works like this." 

We'll be building our own mental model of how websites work by

### Deconstructing a cookie

notes:
deconstructing a cookie. And I don't mean by eating it.

### Cookies are more like websites than you think

notes:
It turns out that cookies are more like websites than you think.

- Cookies can be defined with 3 characteristics
	- What they're made of
		- Structure
			- Butter
			- Flour
			- Eggs
		- Content
			- Sugar
			- Chocolate Chip
			- Peanut Butter
	- How they look
		- Shape
		- Color
		- Arrangement of content
	- Science: rules that we learned of what interactions we make and how they effect our cookie
		- Recipes are just the ingredients combinations that work well together to make something taste good.
		- Time spent in the oven effects
			- how soft or crunchy it is
			- how hot it is
- Websites can also be defined by 3 characteristics
	- What they're made of
		- These ingredients are described by a file called HTML
		- HTML are the ingredients of a website…without Javascript, the recipe & science, we can’t tell what the website to do. We just have cookie batter which tastes okay but it would be better if we could bake it.
	- How they look
		- The appearance are described in a file called CSS
		- Without the CSS, we won’t be able to “decorate/customize” our websites to make it look better.
	- Science: rules
		- JavaScript allows us to change different parts of our website. This is what separates cookie dough from cookies.

### [Code Tour - File types](https://replit.com/@HigginsCodes/Web-C4C#index.html)

1. Let's see what happens when we remove CSS from our website.
2. Let's see what happens when we remove JS from our website.

> [!Activity] 
> Open up this [example](https://codepen.io/totally-not-frito-lays/pen/dyamGaz) and try changing it to say: "Hello world, my name is Alice!"

notes:
Let's try messing around with a real website. Try out the example from our mental model.
