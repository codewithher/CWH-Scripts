notes:
Now that we know what a website is and why we want to build one, let's see how we can build one. Starting with the design of the website.

### What is a mood board?

> **[Mood Board](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mood-boards/#:~:text=A%20mood%20board%20is%20a,cinema%2C%20industrial%20and%20interior%20design)**:  a collage of images, video frames, patterns, or text that convey a certain feeling at a glance. **inspiration board**

notes:
Designers, much like artists can get inspiration from anywhere. So we borrow a technique that artists use called "mood boarding." This is basically a inspiration board where we put in everything that seems interesting to us in one place.

In our moodboard, we collected a few pictures for the Consumers and emotions we want them to feel, our product and what our cookies look like, what other e-commerce websites look like, and some pictures of the girl scouts website to get inspiration.

### User flow

> **[User Flow](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-are-user-flows/)**: diagrams that display the movements a user makes when using a product.

- like writing an outline for an essay

notes:
This is important for us to do because it allows us to figure out when the user should make what decisions. In our case, we want to map out how users might land on our website, what they might be interested in, and how we can best streamline this experience.

This is similar to writing an outline before you write an essay or report. You want to know what topics you're visiting in advance, to make sure you get all the important points.

---
### Prototype

> **[Prototype](https://www.figma.com/resource-library/what-is-prototyping/)**: ensure your design works in the hands of a user.

- like the rough draft

notes:
This is important for us to do because it allows us to see if our plan works. Sometimes when we make designs, we design as engineers and what is easiest for us to make and do. At the end of the day, it's the user experience that's important because it's the user that accomplishes actions that we want to happen.

Here is where we figure out the layout and navigation of our website.

Prototyping is kinda like writing the rough draft. You may have an idea of how our user should visit our site, but until you're actually visiting the site, we don't know for sure if our plan is working. Our mental model may be different from the mental model of our user.

The reason this comes before building the website is that building the website and making changes afterwards is more expensive than prototyping and then making changes to the prototype.
