### CTA Definition

> **[Call to Action](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/call-to-action-examples)**: part of the website that encourages the audience to do something!

notes:
This is a marketing tool that is used to get the audience to do something! In our case, we want the users to buy cookies so we need to sprinkle in "suggestions" about what we want them to do.

notes:
There are a few different types of Call to Actions, but generally we have these 3 options. One is a button with a link to do something or visit another page.

notes:
Then we have Banners which are a persistent part of the website that let's us know when something is happening.

notes:
Finally we have pop-ups or slide-ins. These are kinda spammy and normally force us to do something about it. It's not a really good user experience but it's good at forcing people to take action.
