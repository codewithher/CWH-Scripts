### Control the flow

notes:
JavaScript is a language that we can use to write logic and algorithms which is just fancy speech for instructions on how to do stuff. Things like recipes are technically algorithms because they tell us the steps we need to take to recreate cookies and other good things!

### Types of control flow
1. Functions
2. Conditionals
3. Loops

---
### Functions
- can belong to objects
- used to teach the computer new words

```js
function eat(food) {
	hand.grab(food);
	mouth.open();
	mouth.insert(food);
	mouth.chew();
	mouth.swallow();
}
```
---
### Conditionals
- choose one option or the other

```js
if (stomach.isHungry() == True) {
	eat();
} else {
	exercise();
}
```

---

### Loops
- repeat action 10 times

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
	// repeats 10 times
	prepareCookie();
}
```

- repeat action until done

```js
while (cookies.state != "ready") {
	bake();
}
```
