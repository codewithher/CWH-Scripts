This project is for [Web-C4C](https://github.com/codewithher/Web-C4C)'s lesson plans.

This project uses a base `script.md` file and uses `.canvas` files for visual aids. Any other visualization tools will be placed in this folder.

Candidates for other visualization tools include [Manim](https://www.manim.community/), [Motion-Canvas](https://motioncanvas.io/), and [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
