# README

> Latest Version Supported is Version 1.0.0

This project is for [Web-C4C](https://github.com/codewithher/Web-C4C)'s lesson plans.

This project uses a base `script.md` file and uses `.canvas` files for visual aids. Any other visualization tools will be placed in this folder.

Candidates for other visualization tools include [Manim](https://www.manim.community/), [Motion-Canvas](https://motioncanvas.io/), and [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)

TODO
- [x] Reorganize Design half of the script to follow format of the second half
- [x] Write a new codepen for selectors
- [ ] Rewrite images to use markdown links
- [x] Rescale images for readme
- [x] Rewrite images to take up their own line
- [ ] Update promotion ribbon to be `hsl` instead of `hsla`

On future re-writes, consider using an exploration-first framework to explore different aspects of the website, complete an aside, then return to the website.
